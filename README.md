# Urban Sound Classification Using Deep Learning

This project was done for a third year curricular unit (Aprendizagem Computacional II).

Using the soundata8k dataset, I developed an MLP model and a CNN model, both from scratch, that are able to classify different sounds.

Every step is documented in the notebooks!
